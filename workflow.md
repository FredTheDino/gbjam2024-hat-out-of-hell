# Workflow
 - Use aseprite for sprite editing - we get animations and an indexed rendering there
    - We need to load this format somehow
    - We need to render it
 - Trackerboy was a pretty simple tracker to use, I'll use that but it exports to wav so should be fine
 - Love2d, I was gonna use Teal, but Lua tooling is better and you can get typehints similar to how python does it
 - We'll need some kind of tooling for processing assets
 - The screen requiement needs some thinking about, I want to be able to scale it up, because 1:1 size is kinda hard to look at with a high DPI
 - We'll also need a game, that's kinda important
 - We'll maybe need a level editor (I've used Tiled, it's worked for me before)

# Other Thoughts
 - We're two programmers, we should solve problems using code
 - The gameboy screen is very small
 - I'd love some controller support :3

# Game Ideas
 - Platformers are fun, and I'd like to make it kinda fast paced - which I think will be interesting
 - Turnbased strategy games?
    - I'm just really bad at strategy games
 - Some kind of logic puzzler?
    - There's a slew of sokoban games, maybe we can find a new twist there?
 - A shooter? Like an arcade style shooter?
 - Some kind of RPG with a twist?
    - Maybe there's some funky "spook"-mechanics at play?
